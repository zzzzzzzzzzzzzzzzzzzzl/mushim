[expenses spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GdVWtft6AXkHJIuaj2r5rlEKIhKqX9Vq2fh8OYfBSTU/edit?gid=0#gid=0) 

In the expenses spread sheet Ive listed the potential mushrooms im considering growing.
currently the list of options im considering is  :
- shitake 
-	oyster
-	lions mane
-	enoki
-	white button
-	cremini	portobello
-	Maitake	Reishi
-	morel

Oyster, lions mane, reshi and enoki  seem like the best options to me. Anything that can be dried seems like a good option and since all medicinal mushrooms can be dried I think they should all are worth consideration. Drying will increase the shelf life and sell through rate so less mushrooms will be wasted

link to an expenses spread sheet. It covers the cost of equipment, the costs to operate the equipment and the expected profit.


### Operational Expenses

    

### Sell-Through Rate
the biggest consideration is going to be the perishable nature of the produce.
the shelflife of fresh mushroms with propper refrigeration is about 1 week. Mushrooms should be sold the same day that they are picked if possible. If it is not possible to sell the mushrooms they should be either dried or donated



# Compliance and Licensing

- 1. Business Registration
Register Your Business: If you are starting a business, you need to register it with the Companies Office. You can do this online through the Companies Office website.
- 2. Food Safety and Handling
Food Act 2014 Compliance: If you are selling mushrooms for consumption, you must comply with the Food Act 2014. This includes ensuring that your food handling practices meet the necessary hygiene and safety standards.
Food Control Plan (FCP) or National Programme: Depending on the scale of your operation, you may need to operate under a Food Control Plan (FCP) or a National Programme. These plans ensure that you meet the food safety requirements. You can get more information and apply through your local council or the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).
- 3. Local Council Regulations
Resource Consent: Check with your local council about any resource consents or zoning regulations that may apply to agricultural or commercial activities on your property.
Building and Health Regulations: Ensure that your growing facilities comply with local building and health regulations. This includes proper waste management and pest control.
